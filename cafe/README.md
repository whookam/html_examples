# Brief
Congratulations on building your first 'Single-Page-Application' (SPA), now you
are ready to take that to the next level. Here we'll introduce a little bit more
javaScript and add a google map to the page. Will will also introduce a menu and
navigate to that section of the page to a fuller experience for the user.

Everything explaining what you need to do, should be in this brief and will walk
you though the creation of this site. 

This will be the first project to introduce you to SCSS (link here).
